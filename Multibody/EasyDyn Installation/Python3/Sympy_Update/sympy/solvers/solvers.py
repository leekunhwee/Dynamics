            if expressions are given, the free symbols in them will
            be extracted automatically.
        'check=True (default)'
            If False, don't do any testing of solutions. This can be
            useful if one wants to include solutions that make any
            denominator zero.
        'numerical=True (default)'
            do a fast numerical check if ``f`` has only one symbol.
        'minimal=True (default is False)'
            a very fast, minimal testing.

            simplify all but cubic and quartic solutions before
            returning them and (if check is not False) use the
            general simplify function on the solutions and the

            system containing floats may fail to solve because of issues
            with polys. If rational=None, Floats will be recast as
            rationals but the answer will be recast as Floats. If the

        'manual=True (default is False)'
            do not use the polys/matrix method to solve a system of
            equations, solve them one at a time as you might "manually".
        'implicit=True (default is False)'
            allows solve to return a solution for a pattern in terms of
            other functions that contain that pattern; this is only
            needed if the pattern is inside of some invertible function
            like cos, exp, ....
        'particular=True (default is False)'
            instructs solve to try to find a particular solution to a linear
            system with as many zeros as possible; this is very expensive
        'quick=True (default is False)'
            when using particular=True, use a fast heuristic instead to find a
            solution with many zeros (instead of using the very slow method
            guaranteed to find the largest number of zeros possible)

    * single expression with no symbol given

          In this case, all free symbols will be selected as potential
          symbols to solve for. If the equation is univariate then a list
          of solutions is returned; otherwise -- as is the case when symbols are
          given as an iterable of length > 1 -- a list of mappings will be returned.

    * when an object other than a Symbol is given as a symbol, it is
      isolated algebraically and an implicit solution may be obtained.
      This is mostly provided as a convenience to save one from replacing
      the object with a Symbol and solving for that Symbol. It will only
      work if the specified object can be replaced with a Symbol using the
      subs method.

          {A[1]: 1, A[2]: 2}

            [-LambertW(1)]
            >>> solve(x + exp(x), x, implicit=True)
            [-exp(x)]

        * It is possible to solve for anything that can be targeted with
          subs:

            >>> solve(x + 2 + sqrt(3), x + 2)
            [-sqrt(3)]

    Notes
    =====

    assumptions aren't checked when `solve()` input involves
    relationals or bools.

    When the solutions are checked, those that make any denominator zero
    are automatically excluded. If you do not want to exclude such solutions
    then use the check=False option:

        >>> from sympy import sin, limit
        >>> solve(sin(x)/x)  # 0 is excluded
        [pi]

    If check=False then a solution to the numerator being zero is found: x = 0.
    In this case, this is a spurious solution since sin(x)/x has the well known
    limit (without dicontinuity) of 1 at x = 0:

        >>> solve(sin(x)/x, check=False)
        [0, pi]

    In the following case, however, the limit exists and is equal to the the
    value of x = 0 that is excluded when check=True:

        >>> eq = x**2*(1/x - z**2/x)
        >>> solve(eq, x)
        []
        >>> solve(eq, x, check=False)
        [0]
        >>> limit(eq, x, 0, '-')
        0
        >>> limit(eq, x, 0, '+')
        0

def solve_linear(lhs, rhs=0, symbols=[], exclude=[]):
    r""" Return a tuple derived from f = lhs - rhs that is either:

        (numerator, denominator) of ``f``
            If this comes back as (0, 1) it means
            that ``f`` is independent of the symbols in ``symbols``, e.g::

                y*cos(x)**2 + y*sin(x)**2 - y = y*(0) = 0
                cos(x)**2 + sin(x)**2 = 1

            If it comes back as (0, 0) there is no solution to the equation
            amongst the symbols given.

            If the numerator is not zero then the function is guaranteed
            to be dependent on a symbol in ``symbols``.

        or

        (symbol, solution) where symbol appears linearly in the numerator of
        ``f``, is in ``symbols`` (if given) and is not in ``exclude`` (if given).

        No simplification is done to ``f`` other than and mul=True expansion,
        so the solution will correspond strictly to a unique solution.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.solvers.solvers import solve_linear
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z

    These are linear in x and 1/x:

    >>> solve_linear(x + y**2)
    (x, -y**2)
    >>> solve_linear(1/x - y**2)
    (x, y**(-2))

    When not linear in x or y then the numerator and denominator are returned.

    >>> solve_linear(x**2/y**2 - 3)
    (x**2 - 3*y**2, y**2)

    If the numerator is a symbol then (0, 0) is returned if the solution for
    that symbol would have set any denominator to 0:

    >>> solve_linear(1/(1/x - 2))
    (0, 0)
    >>> 1/(1/x) # to SymPy, this looks like x ...
    x
    >>> solve_linear(1/(1/x)) # so a solution is given
    (x, 0)

    If x is allowed to cancel, then this appears linear, but this sort of
    cancellation is not done so the solution will always satisfy the original
    expression without causing a division by zero error.

    >>> solve_linear(x**2*(1/x - z**2/x))
    (x**2*(-z**2 + 1), x)

    You can give a list of what you prefer for x candidates:

    >>> solve_linear(x + y + z, symbols=[y])
    (y, -x - z)

    You can also indicate what variables you don't want to consider:

    >>> solve_linear(x + y + z, exclude=[x, z])
    (y, -x - z)

    If only x was excluded then a solution for y or z might be obtained.

def solve_linear_system(system, *symbols, **flags):
    r"""
    Solve system of N linear equations with M variables, which means
    both under- and overdetermined systems are supported. The possible
    number of solutions is zero, one or infinite. Respectively, this
    procedure will return None or a dictionary with solutions. In the
    case of underdetermined systems, all arbitrary parameters are skipped.
    This may cause a situation in which an empty dictionary is returned.
    In that case, all symbols can be assigned arbitrary values.

    Input to this functions is a Nx(M+1) matrix, which means it has
    to be in augmented form. If you prefer to enter N equations and M
    unknowns then use `solve(Neqs, *Msymbols)` instead. Note: a local
    copy of the matrix is made by this routine so the matrix that is
    passed will not be modified.

    The algorithm used here is fraction-free Gaussian elimination,
    which results, after elimination, in an upper-triangular matrix.
    Then solutions are found using back-substitution. This approach
    is more efficient and compact than the Gauss-Jordan method.

    """ Remove radicals with symbolic arguments and return (eq, cov, dens),
    None or raise an error:

    None is returned if there are no radicals to remove.

    ValueError is raised if there are radicals and they cannot be removed.

    Otherwise the tuple, ``(eq, cov, dens)``, is returned where::

        ``eq``, ``cov``
            equation without radicals, perhaps written in terms of
            change variables; the relationship to the original variables
            is given by the expressions in list (``cov``) whose tuples,
            (``v``, ``expr``) give the change variable introduced (``v``)
            and the expression (``expr``) which equates the base of the radical
            to the power of the change variable needed to clear the radical.
            For example, for sqrt(2 - x) the tuple (_p, -_p**2 - x + 2), would
            be obtained.
        ``dens``
            A set containing all denominators encountered while removing
            radicals. This may be of interest since any solution obtained in
            the modified expression should not set any denominator to zero.
        ``syms``
            an iterable of symbols which, if provided, will limit the focus of
            radical removal: only radicals with one or more of the symbols of
            interest will be cleared.

    ``flags`` are used internally for communication during recursive calls.
    Two options are also recognized::

        ``take``, when defined, is interpreted as a single-argument function
        that returns True if a given Pow should be handled.
        ``all``, when True, will signify that an attempt should be made to
        remove all radicals. ``take``, if present, has priority over ``all``.

    Radicals can be removed from an expression if::

        *   all bases of the radicals are the same; a change of variables is
            done in this case.
        *   if all radicals appear in one term of the expression
        *   there are only 4 terms with sqrt() factors or there are less than
            four terms having sqrt() factors
