From version 1.2 to version 1.3
-------------------------------

No difference for the user. A few lines have been changed for compatibility 
with the last version of mingw under Windows.

From version 1.1 to version 1.2
-------------------------------

The following features have been changed or added

- mode shapes can also be animated; mode shapes can be loaded in two
manners: from .vol and .vmo data files, or from universal data files
(see README)

- the index of the nodes, edges and surfaces (wich was not used) has
been replaced by an alphanumeric name; only the name of the nodes can
be used to define the edges and the surfaces; in a near future, we
hope to be able to visualize the name of the elements on request.


From version 1.0 to version 1.1
-------------------------------

The following features have been changed or added

- the nodes can now be represented, by spheres whose radius is adjustable
- the edges are now represented as cylinders whose radius is adjustable
- the visualization of nodes, lines and sides can be switched on or off
  independently by means of buttons
- a slider has been added to control the animation speed
- the animation process is visualized on a slider from which you can also
  choose the represented image
- the backward button works
- the animation  restarts at the end only if the LOOP button is pushed
