# What is a Multibody System ? 何为多体系统？

Generally speaking, any physical system which can be seen as a set of rigid or flexible bodies, connected to each other by kinematic joints (revolute, prismatic, cylindrical, spherical, ...) restraining their relative motion or force elements (springs, dampers, actuators, . . . ) can be considered as a multibody system (MBS).

通常来说，任何一组通过运动副（旋转副、平移副、柱面副、球面副等）或力单元（弹簧、阻尼、驱动器等）互相连接的刚性体或柔性体都可以被视为是多体系统。
